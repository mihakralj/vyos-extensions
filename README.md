# VyOS Extensions

A collection of packages, plugins, and extensions for VyOS - stuff added for fun, functionality and experimentation..

## Overview

VyOS is a powerful routing/firewalling system, but its configuration schema is hard-baked during build time and doesn't allow for arbitrary configuration nodes being added during runtime. This repository provides crafted packages that work around these limitations and extend VyOS functionality with new services and features.

## Current Packages
